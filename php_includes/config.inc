>>>>>>> IMPORTANT NOTICE <<<<<<<<
The number of required supporters will be, if not existing in tables "variables" in the remote DB,
updated to the number you set above (ie. first run), BUT, if there's already a definition for it in the DB,
the DB one will be the one used by the interface.
You can change the amount of required supporters using the website itself in 'ACL Manager'.
You must be 901+ to view the [Modify] button next to number of required supporters, ensure
the "New Regs" are LOCKED (at the top of the ACL Manager page) then click on the [Modify] button,
One button there will allow you to reset to "config.inc"'s setting, or change to another number,
after validating, re-open "New Regs" and see the changes.
This requires to login with a user with an admin access of 901 or above (coder level only).
